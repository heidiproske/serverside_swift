# Server-side Swift

Contains multiple small projects illustrating concepts related to coding server-side Swift.

## Projects
The commit descriptions can be read in sequence for more details.

### introToServerSwift
This project illustrates:

* how to handle routes and parse different types of parameteres
* making templates (using stencils) to separate UI code from server swift code

## Dependencies
* [Kitura](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura) - An HTTP server and web framework for writing Swift server applications.
* [HeliumLogger](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/HeliumLogger) - A simple, lightweight logging framework for Swift.
* [StencilTemplateEngine](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine) - A simple and powerful template language for Swif. Templates allow you to create HTML in a file outside of your Swift sourcecode to help keep your UI separate from your controller code.

## Acknowledgments

* Attended the 2017 [Forward Swift](https://forwardswift.com) Server-Side Swift workshop with [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).
